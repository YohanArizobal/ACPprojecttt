The Family Tree Manager is a Python application that allows you to create, manage, and explore hierarchical family tree structures. It enables users to add persons to the tree as offspring or siblings of current members, examine the complete family tree in a structured fashion, and obtain comprehensive information about specific individuals, such as age, gender, siblings, children, and parents. The program ensures correctness by validating inputs for age and gender while being flexible in relationship management. Users can also remove individuals from the tree without causing structural damage, or erase the entire tree if necessary. The Family Tree Manager, with its interactive and user-friendly command-line interface, is an intuitive and efficient tool for organizing, visualizing, and managing family ties in a straightforward yet comprehensive manner.

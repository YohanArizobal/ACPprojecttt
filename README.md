The provided Python code implements a family tree data structure and associated operations. The Person class represents an individual with attributes like name, age, gender, child, and sibling. The FamilyTree class manages the overall structure, allowing for the addition, search, display, and deletion of family members. When adding a new person, the user specifies their relationship to an existing member, and the code efficiently links them using pointers. The search and display_tree methods utilize recursive traversal to find and visualize the family tree. The remove_person method carefully updates pointers to remove a person from the tree. The main function provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the family tree, allowing users to add, search, display, and delete family members. This code effectively models a family tree, enabling the tracking and visualization of familial relationships.
